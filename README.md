# Library App

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library). It involves building a simple library application using JavaScript. The app allows users to add, view, and manage a collection of books. Key features include:

-   Adding new books with details such as title, author, and read status.
-   Displaying the list of books in a user-friendly interface.
-   Updating the read status of each book.
-   Removing books from the library.

This project helps in understanding DOM manipulation, object-oriented programming, and local storage in JavaScript.
